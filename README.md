## Description

Challenge was completed using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript. It was choosen because it provides validation, swagger documentation, dependency injection, separation logic into services and controllers. Also it provides good setup config with eslint, prettier, installed dependencies.
